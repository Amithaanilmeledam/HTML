        <h2>What is the Amoeba Virus?</h2>
        <p>
          The so-called "Amoeba Virus" refers to
          <strong>Naegleria fowleri</strong>, a rare but deadly brain-eating
          amoeba found in warm, stagnant freshwater environments such as ponds,
          lakes, and hot springs. It enters the human body through the nose,
          typically when a person is swimming or diving in contaminated water.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once inside the body, the amoeba travels to the brain, where it causes
          a condition known as
          <strong>Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM)</strong>. This
          infection is almost always fatal, with a high mortality rate and rapid
          progression of symptoms such as headache, fever, nausea, vomiting,
          stiff neck, and seizures.
        </p>

        <p>
          Naegleria fowleri is not harmful when swallowed, as stomach acid kills
          it. The danger arises only when water carrying the amoeba enters the
          nasal passages. Sadly, due to its fast-acting nature, PAM often
          results in death within 5 to 7 days of symptom onset.
        </p>

        <p>
          Awareness and prevention are the best defenses. Avoid swimming in
          warm, still water, especially during hot weather, and never allow
          water to enter your nose in such environments.
